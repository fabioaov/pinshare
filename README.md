# PinShare

PinShare is a small World of Warcraft addon to improve the new Shadowlands map pins.

It has two simple features:
* Auto share your pins with party/raid members (it will set the waypoint without the need to click anything)
* Auto track new pins

## Install

Install it with your addon manager or download it from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pinshare) and extract it on the addons folder.
